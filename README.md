# Numbers-and-ASCII-challenge
Write a single chain of JavaScript methods that we can execute on the following ASCII array, to convert it into a sentence.
var ascii = [73, 32, 115, 112, 101, 97, 107, 32, 105, 110, 32, 110, 117, 109, 98, 101, 114, 115]
So you would do something like:

ascii.function1(..).function2(..).function3(..) ..
and the result would be the numbers above converted form ASCII to text (Note: you can only use JS built-in functions for this!)
